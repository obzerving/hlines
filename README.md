# hlines
 Inkscape extension for "unwinding" paths

For each selected path element, this extension creates an additional path element consisting of horizontal line segments which are the same size as the originalline segments.

Installing:
 
Copy hlines.inx and hlines.py into your Inkscape user extensions directory. Where is that? Open Inkscape and go to the System section of the Preferences menu (Edit --> Preferences --> System). You will find a User extensions item containing the path to your user extensions directory.
 
NOTE: This extension works under Inkscape version 1.02 and above.
